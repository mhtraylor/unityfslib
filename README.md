unityfslib
==========

API wrapper, wiki, and examples for using F# with the Unity 3D game engine.

## What It Do ##

This library is under heavy development. Don't expect a release or cohensive documentation anytime soon. Most of the sweet action takes place on the [development branch](https://github.com/mhtraylor/unityfslib/tree/development) at the moment.

The goals of this project are:

+  FSharp shim functions for the most common uses of the Unity API, with an emphasis on function composition and pipelining
+  Certain useful types, type extensions, and computation expressions to make working with the Unity API and types easier and
more *a propro* to the functional paradigm.
+  A community wiki and full example projects, *a la* the Unity Community wiki, in order to share example code with tips, tricks,
and best practices for using FSharp with the Unity game engine.

This project is open for anyone to contribute, and guidelines for code and wiki article submissions will be posted as soon as we get the
framework for the library and wiki up and at 'em.
