Don't expect a release or cohensive documentation anytime soon. The goals of this\r\nproject are:\r\n\r\n+  F# shim functions for the most common uses of the Unity API, with an emphasis on function composition and pipelining\r\n+  Certain useful types, type extensions, and computation expressions to make working with the Unity API and types easier and\r\nmore congenial to the functional paradigm.\r\n+  A community wiki and full example projects, *a la* the Unity Community wiki, in order to share example code with tips, tricks,\r\nand best practices for using FSharp with the Unity game engine.\r\n\r\nThis project is open for anyone to contribute, and guidelines for code and wiki article submissions will be posted as soon as we get the\r\nframework for the library and wiki up and at 'em.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
